      I'm currently an Engineer at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/technocrat-it/mycompany/" target="_blank">Technocrat IT</a> building things for the web with some awesome people. I recently graduated from the
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://uniben.edu/" target="_blank">University of Benin</a> with a degree in Computer Science.

      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen coding</strong>, I'm probably scrolling through YouTube, reading something tech-related,
      or cooking up product ideas.
